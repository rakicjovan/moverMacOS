Prevents "away" status in Teams and other software by pressing "shift" every 4 minutes if user is inactive.

Simply start the python script, it checks every 30 seconds if the user was idle for more than 4 minutes, if yes, it will press shift once.
This will prevent Teams from showing the away status.
